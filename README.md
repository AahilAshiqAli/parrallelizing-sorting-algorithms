# Introduction
In this project, we implemented parallel programming on sorting random numbers using three different sorting algorithms and compared their performance. 
The performance of each algorithm is subjective of the time taken to sort the data. 
We tested count sort, merge sort and selection sort algorithms.
We changed the input size on all 3 sorting algorithms and displayed the time taken on single thread and multiple threads.
